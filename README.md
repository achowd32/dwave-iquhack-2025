We take on D-Wave's harder challenge of implementing a solution to an advanced version of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). We introduce a method for combining matrices and penalizing select cells, which allows us to solve QAP in time dependent systems, evaluate costs involved in transitioning between states, and distinguish between various kinds of actors involved in the problem formulation.
